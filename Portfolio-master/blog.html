							<p>My background is in the wellness industry.  I became a Licensed Massage Therapist in 2005.  I am a natural healer and Reiki master.  One might ask, "How did I get into web development?" Ok, let me tell you.  I injured my shoulder really bad in the summer of 2017 and I thought my wellness career was finished. I began looking for other career avenues and education without having to go to a university. I lacked resources such as money and time to spend my whole day in a formal school setting. What will I do? I took computer courses thoughtout my school days and I new some web developers that said I could learn how to code from the comfort of my home or coffee shop. Wow, that sounds legit.  So I began my journey.  In Sept. of 2017 I started phase 1 of the scholarship challange with <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>.  This was my first experience with HTML.  They give you all of the tools and course work for free HTML and CSS.  I thought it was wonderful and I was using my brain in different ways.  In Jan. 2018 I learned that I was accepeted into phase 2 and was completely floored because there are some really seasoned coders out there.  So I began my challage with list of projects and we had a three month window to get the course work completed.  Well "I DID IT".  At the end of April 2018 I found out that I was fortunate to recieve the Grow with Google Scholarship. I could not believe it!! What an amazing oppurtuntiy I have recieved. Thank you Udacity and Google for changing my life!! Now between running my own business and raising kids I am doing this.  At times I want to bang my head against a wall, but I keep moving forward.  I have two projects left before I can get my Nanodegree and I could not be more happy or proud to be exactly where the universe wants me to be.
