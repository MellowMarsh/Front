#My First Portfolio Site

Reformatted and constructed by me. This site will eventually change and adapt to my changing vision for it and I may entirely abandon the base code all together.

##Recent Projects:

1. This is a recent freelance site. I really enjoyed this. This is a simple site system. The goal was to have a contract agreement and payment system set up for a rural maintenance business. The owner and operator are thrilled with the functionality and family feel of the new site. [https://asi-im.com/]

2. This is my most recent project that I am working on. The site is changing daily but this is pretty promising work on the front and back end.
